# Akan Name Generator

## Description
The Akan Name Generator is a web application that calculates the day of the week you were born and assigns you an Akan name based on your gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian culture, where children are named according to the day of birth.  
This project combines cultural learning with a vibrant, racing-inspired design theme (BMW M3 GTR blue + Lamborghini orange) to make the experience engaging and modern.
